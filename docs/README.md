# Sequence diagrams of various workflows

## How to generate
These diagrams were built using (UMLGraph)[https://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/].
For sequence diagrams, e.g. run:
```
pic2plot -Tps registration-relay.pic > registration-relay.ps
```

if you want an svg, it can be done through this:
```
pic2plot -Tsvg registration-relay.pic > registration-relay.svg
```
if generated diagrams are clipped, edit the resulting svg (height/with + viewport), see http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/svg-viewport-view-box.html
